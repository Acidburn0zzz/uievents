<h2 id="style-conventions">Stylistic Conventions</h2>


This specification follows the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Schepers/spec-conventions.html">Proposed W3C Specification Conventions</a>,
with the following supplemental additions:

*   The <a href="#key-legends"><em>key cap</em></a> printed on a key is shown as
    KEYCAP{&darr;}, KEYCAP{=} or KEYCAP{Q}. This is used to refer to a
    key from the user's perspective without regard for the
    {{KeyboardEvent/key}} and {{KeyboardEvent/code}} values in the
    generated {{KeyboardEvent}}.

*   Glyphs representing character are shown as: GLYPH{&#x239C2;}.

*   Unicode character encodings are shown as: UNI{\u003d}.

*   Names of key values generated by a key press (i.e., the value of
    {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/key}}) are shown as:
    KEY{ArrowDown}, KEY_NOLINK{=}, KEY_NOLINK{q} or KEY_NOLINK{Q}.

*   Names of key codes associated with the physical keys (i.e., the
    value of {{KeyboardEvent}}.{{KeyboardEvent/code}}) are shown as:
    CODE{ArrowDown}, CODE{Equal} or CODE{KeyQ}.


In addition, certain terms are used in this specification with particular
meanings.  The term <q>implementation</q> applies to a browser, content
authoring tool, or other <a>user agent</a> that implements this specification,
while a content author is a person who writes script or code that takes
advantage of the interfaces, methods, attributes, events, and other features
described in this specification in order to make Web applications, and a user is
the person who uses those Web applications in an implementation.

And finally:
